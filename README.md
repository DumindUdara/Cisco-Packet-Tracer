Cisco packet tracer 

Cisco Packet Tracer is a network simulation and visualization tool developed by Cisco Systems. It allows users to create, configure, and troubleshoot network topologies and test different network scenarios in a virtual environment.

Packet Tracer is commonly used by networking students, educators, and professionals to practice and learn about networking concepts such as routing, switching, wireless networking, and security. It includes a wide range of Cisco networking devices, such as routers, switches, and firewalls, as well as end devices like PCs and servers.

With Packet Tracer, users can create complex network topologies and simulate the behavior of the network, including the transmission of data packets between devices. This allows users to understand how data flows through a network and how different devices interact with each other. Packet Tracer also includes various features to help users troubleshoot network issues and analyze network performance.
