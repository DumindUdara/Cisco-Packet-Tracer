Cisco packet tracer 

Cisco Packet Tracer is a network simulation and visualization tool developed by Cisco Systems. It allows users to create, configure, and troubleshoot network topologies and test different network scenarios in a virtual environment.

Packet Tracer is commonly used by networking students, educators, and professionals to practice and learn about networking concepts such as routing, switching, wireless networking, and security. It includes a wide range of Cisco networking devices, such as routers, switches, and firewalls, as well as end devices like PCs and servers.

With Packet Tracer, users can create complex network topologies and simulate the behavior of the network, including the transmission of data packets between devices. This allows users to understand how data flows through a network and how different devices interact with each other. Packet Tracer also includes various features to help users troubleshoot network issues and analyze network performance.

7.DHCP 

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration settings to devices on a network. DHCP is commonly used in local area networks (LANs) and is implemented by a DHCP server that manages a pool of available IP addresses and leases them to devices on the network as needed.
When a device connects to a network, it sends a broadcast request for an IP address. The DHCP server responds with an available IP address and other configuration settings such as subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses. The DHCP server assigns the IP address to the device for a specified period of time, known as the lease time. When the lease time expires, the device must request a new IP address lease from the DHCP server.
DHCP provides several benefits for network administrators, including easier management of IP addresses and network configuration settings, reducing the likelihood of address conflicts, and enabling automatic configuration of network devices. It also simplifies the process of adding new devices to a network, as they can automatically receive the necessary configuration information without manual intervention.
